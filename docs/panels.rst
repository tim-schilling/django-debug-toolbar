Panels
======

The Django Debug Toolbar ships with a series of built-in panels. In addition,
several third-party panels are available.

Default built-in panels
-----------------------

The following panels are enabled by default.

History
~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.history.HistoryPanel

This panel shows the history of requests made and allows switching to a past
snapshot of the toolbar to view that request's stats.

.. caution::
   If :ref:`RENDER_PANELS <RENDER_PANELS>` configuration option is set to
   ``True`` or if the server runs with multiple processes, the History Panel
   will be disabled.

Version
~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.versions.VersionsPanel

Shows versions of Python, Django, and installed apps if possible.

Timer
~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.timer.TimerPanel

Request timer.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.settings.SettingsPanel

A list of settings in settings.py.

Headers
~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.headers.HeadersPanel

This panels shows the HTTP request and response headers, as well as a
selection of values from the WSGI environment.

Note that headers set by middleware placed before the debug toolbar middleware
in ``MIDDLEWARE`` won't be visible in the panel. The WSGI server itself may
also add response headers such as ``Date`` and ``Server``.

Request
~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.request.RequestPanel

GET/POST/cookie/session variable display.

SQL
~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.sql.SQLPanel

SQL queries including time to execute and links to EXPLAIN each query.

Template
~~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.templates.TemplatesPanel

Templates and context used, and their template paths.

Static files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.staticfiles.StaticFilesPanel

Used static files and their locations (via the ``staticfiles`` finders).

Cache
~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.cache.CachePanel

Cache queries. Is incompatible with Django's per-site caching.

Signal
~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.signals.SignalsPanel

List of signals and receivers.

Redirects
~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.redirects.RedirectsPanel

When this panel is enabled, the debug toolbar will show an intermediate page
upon redirect so you can view any debug information prior to redirecting. This
page will provide a link to the redirect destination you can follow when
ready.

Since this behavior is annoying when you aren't debugging a redirect, this
panel is included but inactive by default. You can activate it by default with
the ``DISABLE_PANELS`` configuration option.

.. _profiling-panel:

Profiling
~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: debug_toolbar.panels.profiling.ProfilingPanel

Profiling information for the processing of the request.

This panel is included but inactive by default. You can activate it by default
with the ``DISABLE_PANELS`` configuration option.

The panel will include all function calls made by your project if you're using
the setting ``settings.BASE_DIR`` to point to your project's root directory.
If a function is in a file within that directory and does not include
``"/site-packages/"`` or ``"/dist-packages/"`` in the path, it will be
included.

Third-party panels
------------------

.. note:: Third-party panels aren't officially supported!

    The authors of the Django Debug Toolbar maintain a list of third-party
    panels, but they can't vouch for the quality of each of them. Please
    report bugs to their authors.

API for third-party panels
--------------------------

Third-party panels must subclass :class:`~debug_toolbar.panels.Panel`,
according to the public API described below. Unless noted otherwise, all
methods are optional.

Panels can ship their own templates, static files and views.

Any views defined for the third-party panel use the following decorators:

- ``debug_toolbar.decorators.require_show_toolbar`` - Prevents unauthorized
  access to the view.
- ``debug_toolbar.decorators.render_with_toolbar_language`` - Supports
  internationalization for any content rendered by the view. This will render
  the response with the :ref:`TOOLBAR_LANGUAGE <TOOLBAR_LANGUAGE>` rather than
  :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE`.

There is no public CSS API at this time.

.. _javascript-api:

JavaScript API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Panel templates should include any JavaScript files they need. There are a few
common methods available.

.. js:function:: djdt.close

    Closes the topmost level (window/panel/toolbar)

.. js:function:: djdt.cookie.get(key)

    This is a helper function to fetch values stored in the cookies.

    :param key: The key for the value to be fetched.

.. js:function:: djdt.cookie.set(key, value, options)

    This is a helper function to set a value stored in the cookies.

    :param key: The key to be used.

    :param value: The value to be set.

    :param options: The options for the value to be set. It should contain the
        properties ``expires`` and ``path``. The properties ``domain``,
        ``secure`` and ``samesite`` are also supported. ``samesite`` defaults
        to ``lax`` if not provided.

.. js:function:: djdt.hide_toolbar

    Closes any panels and hides the toolbar.

.. js:function:: djdt.show_toolbar

    Shows the toolbar. This can be used to re-render the toolbar when reloading the
    entire DOM. For example, then using `HTMX's boosting`_.

.. _HTMX's boosting: https://htmx.org/docs/#boosting

Events
^^^^^^

.. js:attribute:: djdt.panel.render

    This is an event raised when a panel is rendered. It has the property
    ``detail.panelId`` which identifies which panel has been loaded. This
    event can be useful when creating custom scripts to process the HTML
    further.

    An example of this for the ``CustomPanel`` would be:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { $$ } from "./utils.js";
    function addCustomMetrics() {
        // Logic to process/add custom metrics here.

        // Be sure to cover the case of this function being called twice
        // due to file being loaded asynchronously.
    }
    const djDebug = document.getElementById("djDebug");
    $$.onPanelRender(djDebug, "CustomPanel", addCustomMetrics);
    // Since a panel's scripts are loaded asynchronously, it's possible that
    // the above statement would occur after the djdt.panel.render event has
    // been raised. To account for that, the rendering function should be
    // called here as well.
    addCustomMetrics();
